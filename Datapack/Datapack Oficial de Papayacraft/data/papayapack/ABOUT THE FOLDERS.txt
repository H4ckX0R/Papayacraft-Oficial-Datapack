	or you could use the advancements to run functions when the player gets it
	( and you could take the advancement from them in the function that it runs )
	-You can use online generators to generate theese files automatically for you:

## FUNCTIONS ##

	-This is the folder that lets you use in-game commands by making it into a .mcfunction file.
	-To run the function you put in here you simply type "/function yournamespace:yourfunction".
	( unless it's a load and/ or tick function file )
	-This can be automated by either putting it in tick.mcfunction or making your own loop by running itself by delay or instantly

## LOOT TABLES ##
